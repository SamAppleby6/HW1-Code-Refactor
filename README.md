# HW1-Code-Refactor

# The point of this project was to make the Horiseon website more accesible for anyone with disablities or having trouble viewing their site.

# By using semantic tags in html we successfully made their website much more accessible and easier to use than before. We added many <nav> tags to make the links at the top easier to drop down, in addition to adding an aside tag for the Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management section. Finally we added descriptions for all the images on the page for anyone with a disability or anyone that cant view the pictures for any reason.
